# vue-devtools

### NOTES

1. The new vue-devtools only works with Vue.js 1.0.0+.

2. The devtool will only work with non-minified versions of Vue, because the devtools hooks are stripped in production builds. This also includes builds produced by Webpack and Browserify in production mode.

3. Devtools cannot access pages via `file://` protocol. You need to serve the page over HTTP in order to use it.

### Installation

Currently only a Chrome devtools extension is available.

[Get it on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd).

### Hacking

2. `npm install`
